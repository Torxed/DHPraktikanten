DreamHack Support - queue and notification system
(via sms, irc, skype, twitter or facebook)


Description:
------------
The idea is to speed up the support process for the DH users,
instead of waiting 1-2 hours at the support booth for help,
you'll get a queue ticket and a notification when it's your time to visit us.

There's optional ways to report your issues, either directly at place or:

A user can send in their issue via:

 - Facebook
 - Twitter
 - Skype
 - IRC
 - SMS

And DHPraktikanen will automaticly send the user a notification when it's time to go to the support booth.
Once at the support booth, there might be a 0-10 min waiting delay due to technicaleties but it's better then waiting 2hours for support.
